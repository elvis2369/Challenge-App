# Challenge-App

The application requests 250 responses from https://randomuser.me/ and they can be seen on the table. In the table are displayed for each response the first name, the last name, the email adress and the thumbnail. For the thumbnail if you click on the it, a modal will appear on the screen with a bigger picture than the previous one. If the user desires to close the modal, he can press the 'x' or outside the modal.

Above the table are 2 input text fields and 3 buttons.

Filter button: the user has to introduce a country name and afterwards press filter. On the table will be displayed all the responses that contain the desired country. If this condition in not fulfilled then an empty table will appear on the screen. If the user presses the filter button when the input text next to the filter button is empty, then on the table will appear all the responses that were before the user pressed the filter button.

Sort button: next to the filter button there is a sorting button. When the user presses this button then all the rows are sorted by the country field.

Search button: the user introduces a desired word in the input field and on the table will appear all the responses that contain that word. If the input field is empty when pressing the search button, then on the table will appear all the responses that were before the user pressed the search button. Same scenario as in the filter button.
